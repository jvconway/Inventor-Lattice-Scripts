# Sample Inventor Files
 This folder contains a layout_table file, an Inventor Assembly file, and all of the necessary base Inventor Part files for all of the lattice elements.
 If you copy all of these files, open the Inventor Assembly file, and run Rule 0, it should generate all of the different element part files and place them in the Assembly.
