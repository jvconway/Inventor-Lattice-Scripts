# v1 - Dave Burke - UCS's
 This method was developed and used by Dave Burke in the design of the CBETA ERL at Cornell. His documentation and relevant files are included. I believe this is a good method for mature accelerator designs and detailed engineering.
 
 # Procedure
 1. TBA

# Pros
-Excel file linked to Inventor part file with UCS's. If UCS needs to be moved, can update excel file and this will propagate changes, any elements or other parts attached to UCS downstream will move along with it.

# Cons
-Takes a long time to set up. Not good for rapid, major design changes, but ok for mature design where few changes will happen.
